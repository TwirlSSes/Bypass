# Bypass

Free working bypass, but outdated.

IMPORTANT: Outdated bypass, as im not giving out insane bypasses for free obviously. (If you'd like to purchase a bypass and ill set it up personally msg me on discord: twirl.msc.dll)

Steps:

1- Open taskschd (Task scheduler), and create a task hidden or replaced with a legit schedule. Schedule it to run Taskmgr (Task manager) at login. This bypass some server banning you for 
schedueling CMD. After you've schedueled Taskmgr reset your pc to test if it works. (If it works press on Fike -> Run new task -> CMD)

2- Name your cheat something that has to do with SysWOW64 files or Sys32 files. (Example: xgameruntime.dll) and create 2 files. Name the first one Z‎one.I‎dentifier.txt, Put anything in
the txt file. (As in get a random txt file from Sys32 or SysWOW64 and take its contents and paste it onto this txt file) then name it Zone.Identifier without the .txt

3- Now get a well known app (Steam, Exitlag, Epicgameslauncher, Badliom, Spotify, Etc...) go into its directory and make a txt file inside it put in a clutter with other files and do
the same thing as the last step; get a random txt file from it and copy paste its contents into this fake file.

Now you've finished up setting your bypass, to use it do the following:

Open 2 cmds at pc launch, put in the first one:

1- type "C:\Windows\System32\cheat" > "C:\Users\PC NAME\Videos\Clips:‎Z‎one.I‎dentifier"
2- forfiles /p C:\windows\system32 /m taskmgr.exe /c "C:\Users\PC NAME\Videos\Clips:‎Z‎one.I‎dentifier" 

If you get forzen with the 2nd CMD, put in:

type "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\public\Trusted file.txt" > "C:\Users\falox\Videos\Clips:‎Z‎one.I‎dentifier" 

Congrats, you've bypassed for the 1st time without purchasing a bypassing from anyone.
